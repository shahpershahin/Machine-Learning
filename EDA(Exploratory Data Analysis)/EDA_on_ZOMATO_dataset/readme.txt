This repository contains the code for an exploratory data analysis of the Zomato dataset. The dataset contains information about restaurants on Zomato, including their name, location, cuisine, and rating.

The code in this repository performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries.
2. Reads the data from a CSV file.
3. Explores the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
4. Identifies any potential problems with the data, such as missing values or outliers.
5. Cleans the data as needed.
6. Performs further analysis on the cleaned data.

The results of the analysis are presented in a Jupyter notebook. The notebook includes visualizations of the data, as well as a discussion of the findings.


The code in this repository can be used as a starting point for your own exploratory data analysis of the Zomato dataset. It can also be used to learn about the different steps involved in data analysis, such as data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

Once you have installed these dependencies, you can clone this repository to your computer using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/zomato-eda.git
